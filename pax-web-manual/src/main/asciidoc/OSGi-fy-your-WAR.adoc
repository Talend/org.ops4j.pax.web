OSGi-fy your WAR
================

This page explains what it takes to make a standard war file deployable
into OSGi. For detailed information read _OSGi Service Platform Core
Specification_ section 3.2 — __Module Layer — Bundles__. The pages
specified bellow refers to __Release 4, Version 4.1 April 2007__.

The quickest way is for your project to use Maven and utilize Maven
Bundle Plugin to generate OSGi manifest for your WAR project. See:
https://ops4j1.jira.com/wiki/display/ops4j/Getting+the+benefits+of+maven-bundle-plugin+in+other+project+types[Getting
the benefits of maven-bundle-plugin in other project types]

If you opt for a lower level way, read on…

First of all the war has to be a valid OSGi bundle. As minimum the war
file must contain the following manifest headers in
`META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`:

* *_Bundle-ManifestVersion: 2_* — This header defines that the bundle
follows the rules of R4 specification.
* *_Bundle-SymbolicName_* — This header specifies a unique,
non-localizable name for this bundle. This name should be based on the
reverse domain name convention. See _Bundle-SymbolicName_ on page 35.
* (optional) *_Bundle-Version_* — This header specifies the version of
this bundle. The default value is 0.0.0. See _Version_ on page 28.
* (optional) *_Bundle-Name_* — This header defines a readable name for
this bundle. This should be a short, human-readable name that can
contain spaces.
* (optional) *_Bundle-Vendor_* — This header contains a human-readable
description of the bundle vendor.
* (optional) *_Bundle-Copyright_* — This header contains the copyright
specification for this bundle.
* (optional) *_Webapp-Context_* — servlet context path. If not specified
_Bundle-SymbolicName_ will be used. Note that this header is a War
extender specific header not an OSGi header.
image:images/icons/emoticons/warning.png[(warning)] Deprecated since
1.0.0 use
* (optional) *_Web-ContextPath_* — servlet context path, as specified in
the OSGi spec. If not specified _Bundle-SymbolicName_ will be used. Note
this is a official OSGi header.

If you have this header, will suffice to deploy the war into OSGi. But
this is not enough to have it working in most of the situations as OSGi
has a very strict class loading policy. So next, you will have to
specify how the classes you need in runtime will be found via the
following headers:

* *_Bundle-ClassPath_* — This header defines a comma-separated list of
JAR file path names or directories (inside the bundle) containing
classes and resources. The period (’.’) specifies the root directory of
the bundle’s JAR. The period is also the default. See _Bundle Class
Path_ on page 49.
* *_Import-Package_* — This header declares the imported packages for
this bundle. See _Import-Package Header_ on page 36.
* (not recommended) *_Require-Bundle_* — This header specifies the
required exports from another bundle. See _Require-Bundle_ on page 65.

Most likely the above headers will have to have the following values:

* *_Bundle-ClassPath_* :
** `WEB_INF/classes` — this will find any class / file in
WEB-INF/classes
** `lib/<dependency>.jar` — you should have an entry for each jar you
have in your lib directory, where _<dependency>_ is the name of jar +
 So, as an example the header can look like: +
+
`Bundle-ClassPath: WEB-INF/classes,lib/commons-logging.jar,lib/spring.jar`
* *_Import-Package_* : should contain any package that your web
application depends on but is not included into one of your dependencies
that you listed in the _Bundle-ClassPath_ header. Usually a war will not
include _J2EE_ apis:
+
** `jakarta.servlet` - servlet api
** `jakarta.servlet.http` - servlet api +

 So, as an example the header can look like: +
 `Import-Package: jakarta.servlet,jakarta.servlet.http`

Now you are ready to
https://ops4j1.jira.com/wiki/display/paxrunner/Pax+Runner[deploy your
war]. If you still get class loading exceptions then is most likely that
you did not include all the jars you need in the _Bundle-ClassPath_ or
__Import-Package__.
