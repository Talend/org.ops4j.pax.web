= Whiteboard Extender

Pax Web Extender Whiteboard is an extender bundle that ease the pain of
registering servlets, resources, filters and listeners and keeping track
of Http Service availability. +
 Note it is not mandatory for the extender to work with Pax Web, it can
work with any Http Service implementation.

NOTE: starting with Pax Web 6.0.0 the Whiteboard Extender is OSGi R6 compliant. 

[[WhiteboardExtender-KeepingtrackofHttpServiceavailability]]
== Keeping track of Http Service availability

There are many situations that you have to handle as a bundle developer
to keep track of http service availability:

* The Http Service is not present
* The Http Service gets started after your bundle starts
* The service gets unregister during the lifetime of your servlet
* A new service gets registered

Pax Web Extender handles all of this cases for you. You just have to
have a servlet image:icons/emoticons/smile.png[(smile)]

[[WhiteboardExtender-Howdoesitwork:]]
== How does it work:

1.  Publish your web elements using one of the
methods below;
2.  Start the Pax Web Extender bundle. It does not matter if the
Extender starts before or after you bundle or if is not even installed
by the time your bundle starts.

[[WhiteboardExtender-WhatExtenderwilldo:]]
== What Extender will do:

1.  Once it starts it will find out all published web elements;
2.  Once a http service become available (including the moment when
Extender starts) it will register all the
published web elements;
3.  If the in use http service gets unregister it will automatically
unregister the (already) registered web elements;
4.  If you register a web element as a service it will register it automatically with the http
service in use (if any);
5.  If you unregister a web element it will unregister it automatically from the http service (if
was registered before);
6.  If you stop your bundle all registered web elements are automatically
unregistered

[[WhiteboardExtender-Howdoesithelponservletregistration]]
== How does it help on servlet registration

Usually you will have to register servlets by getting an http service
and registering each servlet you have with the http service. +
 By using the whiteboard approach you will just have to register each
servlet that you expect to be published to an http service under the
Servlet interface (http://issues.ops4j.org/jira/browse/PAXWEBEX-2[see in
jira]):

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dictionary props = new Hashtable();
props.put( "alias", "/whiteboard" );
props.put("servlet-name", "My Servlet");
bundleContext.registerService( Servlet.class.getName(), new MyServlet(), props );
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is all you have to do to register a servlet. As you can see there
is no necessity to lookup a http service or to track it’s availability.

Nice to know: your bundle will not have to import/depend on Http Service
packages.

[NOTE]
====
* Registering with Servlet names becomes necessary if you want to register a Filter
against it. See below.
* Starting with version 4.1.x it is possible to register Annotated Servlets as services.
Those annotations are interpreted in the same way as properties. This way properties
may be neglected.

[[WhiteboardExtender-Howdoesithelponresourceregistration]]
== How does it help on resource registration

Usually you will have to register resources by getting an http service
and registering each resource dir you have with the http service. +
 By using the whiteboard approach you will just have to register each
resource dir that you expect to be published to an http service under
the Resources class (http://issues.ops4j.org/jira/browse/PAXWEBEX-4[see
in jira]):

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
import org.ops4j.pax.web.service.whiteboard.ResourceMapping;
import org.ops4j.pax.web.extender.whiteboard.runtime.DefaultResourceMapping;
...
DefaultResourceMapping resourceMapping = new DefaultResourceMapping();
resourceMapping.setAlias( "/whiteboardresources" );
resourceMapping.setPath( "/images" );
bundleContext=bundleContext.registerService( ResourceMapping.class.getName(), resourceMapping, null );
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Don’t forget to import org.ops4j.pax.web.service.whiteboard package.

This is all you have to do to register resources. As you can see there
is no necesity to lookup a http service or to track it’s availablity.
The resources are served upon exact match, so listing directories in
this fashion is not supported right now.

Note: your bundle must import org.ops4j.pax.web.service.whiteboard
package.

[[WhiteboardExtender-Howdoesithelponfilterregistration]]
== How does it help on filter registration

Filters can be registered against URL Patterns and/or against Servlets
(identified using their names).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dictionary props = new Hashtable();
String[] urls = {"/foo", "/protected"};
String[] servlets = {"My Servlet", "Faces Servlet"};
props.put("filter-name", "My Crazy Filter");
props.put("urlPatterns", urls);
props.put("servletNames", servlets);
bundleContext.registerService(Filter.class.getName(), new MyCrazyFilter(), props );
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[NOTE]
====
. For URL Patterns, the pattern registered must be already mapped,
either as Resource or a Servlet alias - e.g there should already be a
Resource or aServlet registered to the path `/foo`.
. For Servlet names, the names used should have been the name that has
been explicitly given to the Servlet (as `servlet-name`), when
registering.

[[WhiteboardExtender-Howdoesithelponlistenerregistration]]
== How does it help on listener registration

Following specialization of java.util.EventListener are
tracked by the Whiteboard-Extender:

* jakarta.servlet.ServletContextListener
* jakarta.servlet.ServletContextAttributeListener
* jakarta.servlet.ServletRequestListener
* jakarta.servlet.ServletRequestAttributeListener


[[WhiteboardExtender-Webelements]]
== Web elements

By web elements we mean any of http context, servlet, resources, filter,
listener.
